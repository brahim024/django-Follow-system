This means that your users will be able to 
follow each other and track what other users share on the platform. The relationship 
between users is a many-to-many relationship: a user can follow multiple users and 
they, in turn, can be followed by multiple users.
## I will :
* Creating many-to-many relationships with an intermediary model
* Creating an activity stream application
* Adding generic relations to models
* Optimizing QuerySets for related objects
* Using signals for denormalizing counts
* Storing item views in Redis
